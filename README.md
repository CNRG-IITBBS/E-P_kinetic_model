### Enhancer-promoter kinetic model
The code is based on gillespie algorithm considering interactions among enhancers, promoters, activators and repressors. It is a generalized model of regulatory element interactions and can be extended for to see various biological phenomena. The code is written in R2022A version of the MATLAB.
